<b>Seasons of Code</b> is a programme launched by the <b>WnCC</b>, along the lines of <b>GSoC</b> without much greenery though. The incentive is similar to <b>ITSP</b>, based on the current form of it, the fundamental difference is that one can choose from the ideas offered by mentors who are senior undergrads, doctorate students or professors, and in some exceptional cases, startups. We plan to have a really long timeframe though, until the next winter extending this programme into a mentorship of sorts into the semester. It is not just about development by the way. We have some mentors ready to take up programmes regarding competitive coding and scientific computation too. <br> <br>
