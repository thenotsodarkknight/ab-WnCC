<!--break-->

<p>Problem Statement : Here, we plan on building an efficient algorithm and writing a script for this purpose at the same time maximising the accuracy. Detecting emotions from the facial features and speech have seen several advancements. Text based recognition is an emerging field and uses the latest and cutting edge ML techniques such as recurrent algorithms, sentiment analysis etc. In computational linguistics, this problem is becoming increasingly useful from the application perspective. The biggest challenge in this field is context-dependence of emotions within text.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>A mentee, by the end of the project is expected to get comfortable with handling and tinkering around with several related libraries of Python and certain basic concepts related to this field of Machine Learning.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Proposal : You are expected to mention your familiarity with Machine Learning and other fields which include Linear Algebra and probability theory apart from your motivation in the project proposal. Also, experience with Python programming. Note that these are not the pre-requisites.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>To get a better insight into the specifics of the project and other related details, I suggest you take a look at the dataset and the references posted here. Also, to start off with basic Machine Learning you can go through Andrew Ng’s notes or the course on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" title="Coursera">Coursera</a>. Though, you will be learning on the go.</p>

					<hr />
<p>The task is to build a chatbot for answering FAQs aimed primarily at the newly joined students, faculty and staff at the Institute.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>A freshman joining the institute has a lot of information to search, assimilate and keep track of. How can I get my internet working? What is the procedure for registration? When will I get my ID card? Where can I get food late at night around the campus? These are just a few of the very common queries one might have apart from a ton of other tech and admin trivia.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>We all have experience with FAQ pages which are the primary source of information dissemination from an individual lab to the institute level. They are lengthy, bloated, and super boring. Although searchable, one has to search for exact words to find answers.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Chatbots are artificial conversational agents which simulate human conversation. Imagine asking a virtual assistant the questions mentioned above in a Messenger chat-style interface and getting your answers instantly, anywhere on campus. A one-stop solution and no running around the admin offices or labs!</p>

<!--break-->

<p>I wrote a basic FAQbot over summer 2016 for prospective new joiners at the electrical department as a hobby project. It was hosted on the department website for over a semester and was mainly tested by my fellow lab members and used by a few students. Version 1 built on top of the chatterbot library and a barebones flask server. In spite of its limitations, it was a lot of fun to build and learn along the way. Recently with deep learning techniques promising much more customizable chatbots, version 2 I built used a simple neural network backend.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>With this existing codebase and data to build upon, there will be two major tasks as a part of this SoC.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Incorporating personalization and context preservation capabilities with recurrent nets for an enhanced user experience.</li>
  <li>Developing a lightweight and friendly chat frontend. The front-end can be browser-based web chat or via telegram APIs.</li>
</ol>

<!--break-->

<p>Existing Project Repo: <a href="https://github.com/saurabhkm/FAQBot-Keras">https://github.com/saurabhkm/FAQBot-Keras</a>
The dataset on the repo is a stub to avoid spamming!</p>

<!--break-->

<h5 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites:</h5>

<ul>
  <li>No prior experience with chatbots required.</li>
  <li>Coding experience with python is the only hard requirement.</li>
  <li>Hands on with basic machine learning programs is a plus.</li>
  <li>Knowledge of the fundamentals of deep learning and natural language processing is also a plus (can be picked up along the way).</li>
  <li>For the frontend, prior basic web dev/Telegram APIs is not required, a student willing to pick it up along the way is cool!</li>
</ul>

<!--break-->

<p>For students who have participated in Summer of Science(Machine Learning track) before, this would be a great hands-on project! As always, interest and enthu will take us much further!</p>

<!--break-->

<h5 id="proposal-expectations">Proposal expectations:</h5>
<p>Write about your prior experience with things mentioned in the prerequisites and a list any prior machine learning projects completed. Do send across links to your project repos and demos, if any, along with the proposal. Although this is not mandatory but try to include a rough expected timeline for yourself.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Neural Networks are being extensively used for machine translation. While tools like Google Translate might look so practically effective in translation, the accuracy (BLEU scores) of such models on test benchmarks is just in the range of 28-40%! From our initial experiments with such models, we can say that these networks essentially learn to output translations all of which carry the same semantic structure – a different way of referring to the same thing or paraphrasing. There has been some previous work in the domain of learning to align to fixed semantic structure or learning to handle paraphrasing during NMT. We have a simple approach in mind, which we want to try out.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>We stick to the standard Encoder-Decoder architecture for Neural Machine Translation(NMT). To give a brief overview, a recurrent neural network (Encoder) takes the input sequence and converts it to an intermediate hidden representation on which another recurrent neural network (Decoder) operates and produces the output sequence. The standard NMT architecture involves a single encoder and decoder mechanism. Here, essentially, we want to have multiple decoders, each of which can capture a different semantic structure of the sequence. Training these multiple decoders will involve not only maximising the likelihood for prediction for each but also producing diverse outputs among themselves. If successfully learned, this model can learn to produce translations which are different ways of saying the same thing.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>The motivation for this idea comes from an analogy to generative models like GANs. Often GANs suffer from mode collapse, that is they fail to capture different modes in the space of images, and rotate among different modes. Having a ‘n-way’ mixture (which essentially is implemented by multiple decoders), we can prevent such a problem from arising.</p>

<h4 id="why-should-one-choose-this-project">Why should one choose this project?</h4>
<p>This project is more on the lines of exploration so active participation is needed from your side not only for the coding part but also for formulating the problem and thus you will have the freedom to test and implement your own ideas as well. This will be an excellent way to venture into the field of Machine Learning (Deep Learning in specific) and can act as a solid starting point for you to pursue more projects/research in DL. This project will also involve active reading of research papers and hence can be a very hands on research experience for you.
<!--break--></p>

<h4 id="who-should-choose-this-project">Who should choose this project?</h4>
<p>A prerequisite for choosing this project is having a basic knowledge of Neural Networks and concepts of Machine Learning (Though this can also be learnt while doing the project if student is motivated and interested to learn). The student should be comfortable coding in Python and should have ability to learn to program in a new environment (Tensorflow). Any prior experience with Keras, Pytorch or Tensorflow is appreciated.

<h4 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement:</h4>
<p>Image-guided neurosurgery systems (IGNS) play an important role in intracranial surgery. These systems have a live CT/MRI scanning during surgeries to aid the doctor. During neuro-registration, bone based markers or fiducials are affixed to the skull before imaging so that they can calibrate the coordinate systems of the imaging device and the actual 3D World Coordinates. As of now, the actual Fiducials are tapped by instruments, and on the other hand they are MANUALLY marked out in the images obtained from the MRI/CT imaging. Automatic localization of these centers will help to reduce the human error in registration and speed up the registration process.  In a nutshell, the task is to automatically locate these Fiducial markers from these images, so that they don’t have to be manually marked out by the doctor.

<h4 id="practical-details">Practical Details:</h4>
<p>This project was a research challenge provided by scientists working in BARC (Bhabha Atomic Research Centre), during the Inter IIT Tech Meet, 2017 held at IITM. We came second, after developing an algorithm which worked quite well. We believe it can be further worked upon to work extremely well. This task is still open, and scientists in India are actively looking for a solution. Also, we found very little literature on this task, and aim to publish this work too.</p>

<!--break-->
<p>This is a completely new project with no past work.
The project will take the form of an app (android/ios).</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Rumour can be an image, pdf or simply text. Users can choose to create rumours anonymously and then “spread” them anonymously. The interesting point is that rumours are spread over a wifi as a broadcast. All the users connected to the same wifi get the rumour on the phone. These rumours would be shown as a deck in a tinder like fashion. They can then choose to “spread” or “not spread” the rumour (in future when connected to another wifi) by swiping right or left. (Don’t know what the analogous gesture of superlike would mean here! xD) Because of spatial locality, the rumours are guaranteed to be interesting. This is basically like gossip but anonymous. Imagine when you are coming from wing to lecture hall, you carry along all the interesting stuff of hostels to be spread in the lecture hall.</p>

<h3 id="monte-carlo-path-tracing-renderer">Monte Carlo Path Tracing Renderer</h3>
<p>In this project, you will implement a Monte Carlo Path Tracer. A path tracer is a kind of renderer in computer graphics. A renderer is responsible for generating the image or the graphics that you see on your screen. Even this text that you are reading is displayed via a font renderer. Path tracers are often used for photorealistic rendering, which means generating an image indistinguishable from a photograph. At the end of the project, you can expect to have a code capable of producing such images.</p>

<p>Texter takes a piece of boring text, mostly educational and inserts relevant images in between to make the reading interesting.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Texter is something my team developed for the Microsoft Code Fun Do hackathon. Texter takes a piece of boring text, mostly educational and inserts relevant images in between to make the reading interesting. This project serves as an educational aid to the illiterate. There are three deliverables:</p>

<!--break-->

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Chrome Extension:</td>
      <td>which when activated scans the current webpage for all the texts and downloads all the relevant pictures and display it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Android App:</td>
      <td>The app takes some text as input and inserts relevant images in between that text.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Python Script:</td>
      <td>This python script compiles the text, images, downloads audio and compiles it into a video.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The main aim of this Seasons Of Code project would be to analyse the images the API sends and check if those images have text. This images serves as an aid to illiterate, so it wouldn’t make any sense if those images have text. So a model needs to be developed which checks for texts in these images and rejects them.</p>

					<hr />

<p>InstiApp is a WnCC initiative to create a unified platform for everything that happens inside IIT Bombay.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>The chief component of this is events, which aims for students being kept updated with talks, competitions and even informal events happening inside the institute. The broad aim is not only to reduce dependence on social media and word of mouth, but to make this a one-stop solution for all informative, as well as promotional needs.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>The project has three sections:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <strong>API Backend</strong> of the app, which is a RESTful API in Django. This project enforces very strict coding standards and testing routines, so you will essentially learn not only Python and Django, but software development as a whole.</li>
  <li>A <strong>Progressive Web Application</strong> (PWA), written in Angular. You will learn fairly advanced TypeScript, HTML, CSS and JavaScript if you are working on this. It will also involve a lot of async programming, cache handling, performance optimization etc.</li>
  <li>A native <strong>Android App</strong>, which is a separate project</li>
</ol>

<!--break-->

<p>If you are not already familiar with these, you will also learn what REST is, how APIs function, writing tests and ensuring code coverage, what are the security issues and how they are fixed, authorization and authentication in a highly complex permissions model, working with relational databases, search engine optimization, continuous integration and delivery (DevOps) and so on.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Development has already started and basic functionality including events, institute bodies, authorization, placement and training blogs etc. is implemented, so you can skip the boring framework parts and directly jump to really developing something interesting.</p>

<!--break-->

<h3 id="current-state">Current State</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The PWA (with the backend) in its current stage is deployed at <a href="https://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/instiapp/">IITB Gymkhana</a> and a <a href="https://evenire.radialapps.com">staging server</a>. You can also explore the API at the <a href="https://temp-iitb.radialapps.com">backend staging server</a>.</li>
  <li>The backend repository can be found at <a href="https://github.com/wncc/IITBapp">GitHub wncc/IITBapp</a></li>
  <li>The Web Application is under development at <a href="https://github.com/pulsejet/iitb-app-angular">pulsejet/iitb-app-angular</a></li>
  <li>The Android App is under development at <a href="https://github.com/wncc/IITB-app">wncc/IITB-App</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For the backend, you can get a broad idea of what you will be working on by browsing the <a href="https://github.com/wncc/IITBapp/issues">current and past issues</a> at GitHub.</p>

<!--break-->

<h3 id="work-to-be-done">Work to be done</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Implementation of the much-wanted mess menu feature</li>
  <li>Development of a news feed, which will aggregate and display news from various institute bodies.</li>
  <li>Implementation of event tagging</li>
  <li>Implementing the backend and frontend for the map view</li>
  <li>Improving the heuristic used for prioritizing events for users</li>
  <li>Creating the backend for push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)</li>
  <li>Promotional and featured events</li>
  <li>Expanding the existing API further</li>
  <li>Bug hunting and fixing</li>
  <li>More features, which are too many to list here</li>
  <li>Further ideation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="proposal">Proposal</h3>
<p>Include your vision and a general idea of how such an app would be useful for students (or anyone else). Include your ideas on how this could be further expanded, what possible things could be added etc. Make sure you put in your existing work and why you want to work on this. Also state which section you preferentially want to work on, which can be any of <em>Backend</em>, <em>Frontend</em> or <em>Full Stack</em>.</p>
