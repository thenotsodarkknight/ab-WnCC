	<meta name="description" content="InstiApp is a WnCC initiative to create a unified platform for everything that happens inside IIT Bombay.



The chief component of this is events, which aims for students being kept updated with talks, competitions and even informal events happening inside the institute. The broad aim is not only to reduce dependence on social media and word of mouth, but to make this a one-stop solution for all informative, as well as promotional needs.



The project has three sections:


  The API Backend of the app, which is a RESTful API in Django. This project enforces very strict coding standards and testing routines, so you will essentially learn not only Python and Django, but software development as a whole.
  A Progressive Web Application (PWA), written in Angular. You will learn fairly advanced TypeScript, HTML, CSS and JavaScript if you are working on this. It will also involve a lot of async programming, cache handling, performance optimization etc.
  A native Android App, which is a separate project




If you are not already familiar with these, you will also learn what REST is, how APIs function, writing tests and ensuring code coverage, what are the security issues and how they are fixed, authorization and authentication in a highly complex permissions model, working with relational databases, search engine optimization, continuous integration and delivery (DevOps) and so on.



Development has already started and basic functionality including events, institute bodies, authorization, placement and training blogs etc. is implemented, so you can skip the boring framework parts and directly jump to really developing something interesting.



Current State

  The PWA (with the backend) in its current stage is deployed at IITB Gymkhana and a staging server. You can also explore the API at the backend staging server.
  The backend repository can be found at GitHub wncc/IITBapp
  The Web Application is under development at pulsejet/iitb-app-angular
  The Android App is under development at wncc/IITB-App


For the backend, you can get a broad idea of what you will be working on by browsing the current and past issues at GitHub.



Work to be done

  Implementation of the much-wanted mess menu feature
  Development of a news feed, which will aggregate and display news from various institute bodies.
  Implementation of event tagging
  Implementing the backend and frontend for the map view
  Improving the heuristic used for prioritizing events for users
  Creating the backend for push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
  Promotional and featured events
  Expanding the existing API further
  Bug hunting and fixing
  More features, which are too many to list here
  Further ideation


Proposal
Include your vision and a general idea of how such an app would be useful for students (or anyone else). Include your ideas on how this could be further expanded, what possible things could be added etc. Make sure you put in your existing work and why you want to work on this. Also state which section you preferentially want to work on, which can be any of Backend, Frontend or Full Stack.">

<p>If you are not already familiar with these, you will also learn what REST is, how APIs function, writing tests and ensuring code coverage, what are the security issues and how they are fixed, authorization and authentication in a highly complex permissions model, working with relational databases, search engine optimization, continuous integration and delivery (DevOps) and so on.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Development has already started and basic functionality including events, institute bodies, authorization, placement and training blogs etc. is implemented, so you can skip the boring framework parts and directly jump to really developing something interesting.</p>

  <li>The PWA (with the backend) in its current stage is deployed at <a href="https://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/instiapp/">IITB Gymkhana</a> and a <a href="https://evenire.radialapps.com">staging server</a>. You can also explore the API at the <a href="https://temp-iitb.radialapps.com">backend staging server</a>.</li>
  <li>The backend repository can be found at <a href="https://github.com/wncc/IITBapp">GitHub wncc/IITBapp</a></li>
  <li>The Web Application is under development at <a href="https://github.com/pulsejet/iitb-app-angular">pulsejet/iitb-app-angular</a></li>
  <li>The Android App is under development at <a href="https://github.com/wncc/IITB-app">wncc/IITB-App</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For the backend, you can get a broad idea of what you will be working on by browsing the <a href="https://github.com/wncc/IITBapp/issues">current and past issues</a> at GitHub.</p>

<p>Include your vision and a general idea of how such an app would be useful for students (or anyone else). Include your ideas on how this could be further expanded, what possible things could be added etc. Make sure you put in your existing work and why you want to work on this. Also state which section you preferentially want to work on, which can be any of <em>Backend</em>, <em>Frontend</em> or <em>Full Stack</em>.</p>

		<h3>Seasons of Code</h3>
		<p>
			Seasons of Code is a programme launched by the WnCC, along the lines of GSoC without much greenery though. The incentive is similar to ITSP, based on the current form of it, the fundamental difference is that one can choose from the ideas offered by mentors who are senior undergrads, doctorate students or professors, and in some exceptional cases, startups. We plan to have a really long timeframe though, until the next winter extending this programme into a mentorship of sorts into the semester. It is not just about development by the way. We have some mentors ready to take up programmes regarding competitive coding and scientific computation too.

              We're WnCC, the Web and Coding Club of IIT Bombay. We code and help people code. Being the chief coding organisation of one of the most sought after technical institutions in the country, we have some of the very best programmers working with us. This page enlists our ongoing activities. It is maintained by the coding community at IIT-B. We're wncc-iitb on most services. Also, we love XKCD.
